## Description
This application is meant to help produce a professional readme simply by filling out the prompts that are presented to you within your terminal so that you don’t have to worry about the formatting or missing out on key information on future readme’s. It is done using node js and primarily using inquirer.
## Installation
For installation you must first install node.js onto your computer, next you will want to ensure that you have the inquirer package downloaded v8.2.4. Run the index.js file by making sure you are in that file and then running ‘node index.js’ inside of the terminal. 
## Usage
Once you have installed the application and have started running it you will just need to follow the prompts and give satisfactory answers to the questions that are asked./n
